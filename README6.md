Scenario 1 – Bagging

Problem: Predict whether a patient has diabetes

Dataset: Diabetes Dataset

Target Variable: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

Features: Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, etc.

Tasks:
Load dataset
Train Decision Tree model
Apply Bagging Classifier
Compare accuracy

Visualization:
Accuracy comparison bar graph
Confusion matrix

Outcome:
Bagging improved prediction accuracy compared to a single Decision Tree.
Reduced overfitting and provided more stable results.
Better classification performance observed in confusion matrix.

Scenario 2 – Boosting

Problem: Predict customer churn

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Features: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Contract Type

Tasks:
Train AdaBoost model
Train Gradient Boosting model
Compare performance

Visualization:
ROC Curve
Feature Importance plot

Outcome:
Boosting models outperformed basic models by focusing on difficult cases.
Gradient Boosting generally achieved higher accuracy than AdaBoost.
ROC curve showed improved classification capability.

Scenario 3 – Random Forest

Problem: Predict income level (>50K or <=50K)

Dataset: Adult Income Dataset

Target Variable: Income

Features: Age, Education, Occupation, Hours-per-week

Tasks:
Train Random Forest model
Tune number of trees
Evaluate performance

Visualization:
Feature Importance
Accuracy vs Number of Trees graph

Outcome:
Increasing the number of trees improved accuracy up to an optimal point.
Random Forest reduced overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree.
Feature importance helped identify key predictors of income.

Scenario 4 – Stacking

Problem: Predict heart disease

Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset

Target Variable: Presence of Heart Disease (0/1)

Features: Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, Age

Tasks:
Train base models:
Logistic Regression
SVM
Decision Tree
Combine using Stacking Classifier
Compare with individual models

Visualization:
Model comparison bar chart

Outcome:
Stacking improved overall performance by combining multiple models.
Achieved better accuracy than individual base models.
Leveraged strengths of different algorithms effectively.

Scenario 5 – SMOTE

Problem: Detect fraudulent transactions

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Target Variable: Fraud (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)

Features: Transaction Amount, Time, PCA features

Tasks:
Check class imbalance
Apply SMOTE
Train model before & after SMOTE
Compare performance

Visualization:
Class distribution (Before & After SMOTE)
Precision-Recall Curve

Outcome:
SMOTE balanced the dataset by generating synthetic minority samples.
Improved recall and detection of fraudulent transactions.
Precision-Recall curve showed better performance after applying SMOTE.
