SCENARIO 1: User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Dataset: MovieLens 100K Dataset (Kaggle – Public)
Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajmehra03/movielens100k

Objective: To recommend movies to users based on similar users’ preferences and analyze user similarity patterns.

Tasks Performed:

Imported required Python libraries.
Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Inspected the dataset and checked for missing values.
Created a User-Item matrix using ratings data.
Handled missing values by filling with 0/mean.
Computed user similarity using cosine similarity.
Identified top-N similar users.
Predicted ratings for unseen movies.
Generated Top-N movie recommendations.
Evaluated model using RMSE and MAE.

Visualized:

User-Item matrix using heatmap.
User similarity matrix.
Top recommended movies using bar charts.

Outcome:

The model successfully generated personalized movie recommendations by identifying similar users. It provided reasonable prediction accuracy using RMSE and MAE. However, sparsity in the dataset and cold-start issues affected performance.

SCENARIO 2: Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Dataset: MovieLens Dataset / Alternative Dataset (Kaggle – Public)
Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajmehra03/movielens100k

Objective: To recommend similar movies based on user ratings and analyze item relationships.

Tasks Performed:

Loaded the dataset into Pandas.
Created an Item-User matrix from ratings data.
Computed item similarity using cosine similarity/Pearson correlation.
Identified top-N similar items.
Generated recommendations based on user history.
Compared item-based recommendations with user-based approach.
Evaluated model using RMSE and Precision@K.

Visualized:

Item similarity matrix using heatmap.
Top similar movies using bar graphs.
Recommendation comparison charts.

Outcome:

The model effectively recommended similar movies based on item relationships. It showed better scalability and consistency compared to user-based filtering. Performance was more stable, especially for popular items with sufficient ratings.
