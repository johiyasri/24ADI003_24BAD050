SCENARIO 1: E-commerce Sales Data

Dataset:
E-commerce Data (Kaggle – Public)

Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

Objective:
To analyze e-commerce sales data and understand product categories, sales trends, and missing information.

Tasks Performed:

Imported required Python libraries.

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Inspected the dataset using head(), tail(), info(), and describe().

Checked for missing values in the dataset.

Created a new Sales column using Quantity and Unit Price.

Visualized:

Sales per product using bar charts.

Sales trends over time using line charts.

Outcome:

This analysis helped identify top-selling products, observe sales patterns over time, and detect missing or inconsistent data entries.


SCENARIO 2: Hospital Patient Records

Dataset:
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle – Public)

Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

Objective:
To examine patient health records, identify missing health metrics, and visualize data distributions.

Tasks Performed:

Loaded the dataset into Pandas.

Explored dataset structure and checked for missing values.

Identified zero values representing missing medical data.

Visualized:

Glucose level distribution using histograms.

Age distribution using histograms.

Glucose and BMI variations using boxplots.

Grouped data by diabetes outcome to identify patterns.

Outcome:

The analysis revealed that patients with diabetes tend to have higher glucose and BMI levels. It also highlighted the importance of handling missing medical values properly.


SCENARIO 3: Housing Dataset

Dataset:
Housing Price Prediction Dataset (Kaggle – Public)

Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction

Objective:
To investigate housing features, identify missing values, and study relationships between house attributes and price.

Tasks Performed:

Loaded the dataset and inspected column details.

Detected and summarized missing values.

Visualized relationships using:

Scatter plots (Area vs Price, Bedrooms vs Price, Bathrooms vs Price).

Correlation heatmap for numerical features.

Analyzed correlations to identify key predictors of house prices.

Outcome:

The analysis showed that area, number of bathrooms, and parking have a strong positive influence on house prices. Correlation heatmaps helped identify important features for price prediction.


SCENARIO 4: Customer Personality Analysis

Dataset:
Customer Personality Analysis Dataset (Kaggle – Public)

Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

Objective:
To analyze customer demographics, detect missing information, and understand spending behavior.

Tasks Performed:

Imported the dataset into Pandas.

Examined dataset structure, null values, and column data types.

Created new features such as Age and Total Spending.

Visualized:

Age distribution using histograms.

Income distribution using box plots.

Spending patterns across education levels using bar plots.

Grouped data by marital status to summarize insights.

Outcome:

The analysis revealed that income and education level significantly influence customer spending behavior. Missing income values were identified as an important preprocessing step.# 24ADI003_24BAD050
