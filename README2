Scenario 1: Ocean Water Temperature Prediction
Problem Statement:

Predict ocean water temperature using environmental and depth-related features such as salinity, oxygen, and geographic location.

Dataset:

Source: Kaggle – CalCOFI Dataset

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi

Target Variable:

T_degC – Water Temperature (°C)

Input Features

Depth (m)

Salinity

Oxygen

Latitude

Longitude

Methodology:

Import required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

Select relevant numerical features

Handle missing values using mean/median imputation

Perform feature scaling using StandardScaler

Split data into training and testing sets

Train a Linear Regression model

Predict water temperature on test data

Evaluate model using:

0 → Closing Price ≤ Opening Price

Input Features:

Open

High

Low

Volume

Methodology:

Import required Python libraries

Load stock dataset into Pandas

Create a binary target variable

Handle missing values

Perform feature scaling

Split data into training and testing sets
